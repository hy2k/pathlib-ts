description: High-level tour and navigation for pathlib-ts documentation.
---

Welcome to the living documentation for `pathlib-ts`. These pages expand on the README with deeper explanations, migration notes, and code-focused recipes for day-to-day use.

## Navigation

- [Getting started](./getting-started/) – installation, runtime support, and first steps.
- [Path & PurePath APIs](./api-reference/) – class overview, method catalog, sync/async variants, and policy options.
- [Usage patterns](./usage-patterns/) – end-to-end examples for common filesystem tasks.
- [Caveats & gotchas](./caveats/) – behavioural differences between pathlib-ts in Node-compat runtimes and CPython.

If you need additional pages (for example, glob patterns, contributor workflows, or runtime-specific notes) open an issue or let us know—this skeleton is designed to grow with the project.
